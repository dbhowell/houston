Missing AppStream license

AppStream should contain a `project_license` to inform users in the AppCenter. For examples of licenses, please see [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

For more information, please look at the
[appstream documentation](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/chap-Quickstart.html).
